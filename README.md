# Foundational Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code to help understand the underlying mechanics of these essential algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Dimensionality Reduction**
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
- **Clustering**
  - K-Means
  - K-Means++
  
- **Classification**
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Perceptron
  
- **Regression**
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  
  
- **Neural Networks**
  - Basic Neural Network Implementation
  - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
